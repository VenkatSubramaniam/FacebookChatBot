This app was created using glitch.com and the Facebook Messenger tutorial. 

The only real changes that I made were with regards to allowing someone to contact a user using nothing but their phone number, as well as generating custom messages. If you wish to learn how to create a chat bot, I highly recommend using the above link to learn it. It is very well written, and I was able to do it with no Node.js experience.
